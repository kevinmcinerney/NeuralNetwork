=============================================================================

To run the neural network, cd into the 'src' folder from where you downloaded the project.
First, compile all necessary files by typing the following command;

javac NeuralNetwork.java

Next, run the optimal paramters as so:

java NeuraNetwork 2 0.9 0.9 500 3 false

The paramters are as so:

1) int hidden Layer size 

2) double learning rate  (between 0 - 1)

3) double momentum       (between 0 - 1)

4) Max epochs

5) Number of features   (between 1 - 26)

6) Booster features     (true - false)
